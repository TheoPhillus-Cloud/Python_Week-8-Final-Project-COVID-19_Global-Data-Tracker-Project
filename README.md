Iris Dataset Analysis
Exploring Flower Characteristics Through Data Visualization

Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the famous Iris dataset, identify patterns in sepal and petal measurements across different species, and visualize relationships using various charts.

Tools & Libraries Used
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib: Basic plotting for trends and relationships
- seaborn: Advanced visualization for better styling and insights
- sklearn.datasets: Built-in Iris dataset for machine learning applications

How to Run the Project
- Install necessary libraries (if not already installed):
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
- Run the Python script provided in the repository.
- View printed observations in the console and visualizations displaying insights about species differences.

Observations & Insights
- Sepal length increases gradually across species.
- Petal width varies significantly between species, providing a strong distinguishing factor.
- Line charts highlight measurement trends effectively.
- Scatter plots reveal clustering, reinforcing classification insights.

Reflections
Analyzing this dataset visually enhances understanding of classification concepts and sets the foundation for deeper machine learning applications.
